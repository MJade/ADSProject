Language Analysis and English Comprehension  in Primary School Pupils... 
An analysis of language background on English Comprehension in primary Schools
This study was conducted in order to carry out a descriptive analysis of possible language background effects on English comprehension in elementary education among pupils from a fairly rural background. The insight gained was invaluable. A survey was carried out in 23 primary schools with over one thousand respondents. The forms distributed required basic data collection and a simple comprehension package in English.
Data was cleaned, preprocessed, and analysed in a Pandas dataframe using Jupyter notebook.
